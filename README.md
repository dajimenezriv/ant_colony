# ant_colony

Algorithm for Heuristics (Ant Colony System).

The instance problems are stored in the folders. We have to find the minimum path to connect all terminals (not nodes) from a graph.
However, there are two types of terminals and the shared edges have their weight reduced.

It uses the MAX-MIN modification.
